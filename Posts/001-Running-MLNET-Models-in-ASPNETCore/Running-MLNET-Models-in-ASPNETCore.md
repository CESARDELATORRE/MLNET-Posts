# Running ML.NET models on scalable ASP.NET Core WebAPIs or web apps

This posts explains how to optimize your code when running an ML.NET model on an ASP.NET Core WebAPI service, but the code is very similar when running it on an ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor web app.

Eventually, this kind of optimized code might be provided as an *.NET Core Integration Package* comparable to integration packages targeting Entity Framework, SignalR, etc. so it'll be transparent and a lot easier for you.

However, as of today (March 2019 with ML.NET 0.11 Preview), you can do the following implementation which, once done, is encapsulated in a single class that you can very easily re-use across your ASP.NET Core projects. 

# Goal

**The goal is to be able to make predictions with an ML.NET model while optimizing the executions by sharing objects across Http requests and implementing very simple code when predicting**, like the following line of code that you could write on any ASP.NET Core controller's method or custom service class:

```cs
SamplePrediction prediction = _modelEngine.Predict(sampleData);
```

That's it. Very simple. A single line. The object _modelEngine will be injected in the controller's constructor or you custom class. 

Internally, it will be optimized so the object dependencies are cached and shared across Http requests with minimum overhead when creating those objects.


# Background on scalable and multithreaded ASP.NET Core services and apps

ASP.NET Core services and apps are multithreaded applications so they can serve many HTTP requests at the same time.

.NET Core provides a managed thread pool that is managed by the system. As a developer, you donâ€™t need to deal with the thread management. 

As shown in the simplified image below, and ASP.NET Core WebAPI or web app accepts many Http requests which will be handled by that thread pool.

![alt text](images/Simplified-threading-in-ASPNETCore-app.png "Multi-threads in ASP.NET Core apps")

The specifics of the architecture are not exactly the same if you deploy your application into *IIS* or selfhosted by using *Kestrel*, but those differences are not important in this case.

The bottom line here is that when writing code for a multithreaded application such as ASP.NET Core services or apps **your code and objects used in your code need to be *thread-safe* if the same object is going to be shared across multiple threads while updating data in-memory**. The reason is because if you update data within the same shared object from multiple threads, those multiple threads can access to the same address space at the same time. So, they can write to the exact same memory location at the same time causing data corruption and application mal-function.

A code is called *thread-safe* if it is being called from multiple threads concurrently without the breaking of functionalities. 

### This is usually not a problem in regular ASP.NET Core apps

Usually, most of the code and objects you use in an ASP.NET Core WebAPI or app, for instance, objects you instanciate in a controller, are not shared across Http requests because the most common pattern is to use objects you create for each Http requests scope, either with `new` or with [transient lifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2#service-lifetimes) when using dependency injection in .NET Core, as shown in the following image. Not a problem here:

![alt text](images/Transient-Objects-in-ASPNETCore-app.png "Multi-threads in ASP.NET Core apps")

However, issues can happen if you use share objects across threads, for example by using [static member variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members#static-members) or [singleton lifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2#service-lifetimes) objects in Dependency Injection, as explained later on in this post.

# C# code needed to run an ML.NET model and predict

As you can check out on may ML.NET getting started samples at the [ML.NET Samples GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples), the basic code you need to load an already trained and serialized ML.NET model and predict with it (usually called 'ML model scoring code'), is the following:

```cs
// (*Expensive*) Load ML model from serialized .zip file 
ITransformer mlModel;
using (var stream = new FileStream(modelFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))
{
    mlModel = mlContext.Model.Load(stream);
}

// Create sample data to do a single prediction with it 
SampleObservation sampleData = CreateMySingleDataSample();

// (*Expensive*) Create Prediction Engine
var predictionEngine = mlModel.CreatePredictionEngine<SampleObservation, SamplePrediction>(mlContext);

// Try a single prediction
SamplePrediction predictionResult = predictionEngine.Predict(sampleData);
```

This code looks very atraightforward and simple to use. If you just copy that code and run it on any application (console, desktop, web, etc.) it'll work okay. 

However, the lines of code marked with `(*Expensive*)` in the comments are object instantiations that are significantly 'expensive', meaning that it takes significant time to execute such as 1 or 2 seconds per each call and that can vary depending on the size of the ML model.

## You need to improve your ML.NET model scoring code for scalable apps

As you would initially think, improving that execution for an application that will run multiple predictions could be as simple as 'caching' the ML model (ITransformer) object and the Prediction Engine object, so those objects are instantiaoned just once and shared across the upcoming requests, right?

Well, that is partially true, but there are important caveats here and this is the reason why I created this post, precisely. ;)


# Sharing the ML model (ITransformer) across HTTP requests in ASP.NET Core 

Therefore, the first optimization you could do would be to cache in memory the ML model object that you loaded from the .zip file, so it can be re-used across many Http requests.

Since the **ML model (ITransformer) object is *thread-safe***, this is not an issue and can be done very easily.

The recommended way to share the ITransfomer object across Http requests is to register it as [singleton lifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2#service-lifetimes) object in your IoC container for Dependency Injection usage, as shown in the code below:

```cs
Startup.cs

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    //..Other code..

    // Register Types in IoC container for DI

    //MLContext created as singleton for the whole ASP.NET Core app
    services.AddSingleton<MLContext>();

    //ML Model (ITransformed) created as singleton for the whole ASP.NET Core app. Loads from .zip file here.
    services.AddSingleton<ITransformer,
                            TransformerChain<ITransformer>> ((ctx) =>
                        {
                            MLContext mlContext = ctx.GetRequiredService<MLContext>();
                            string modelFilePathName = Configuration["MLModel:MLModelFilePath"];

                            ITransformer mlModel;
                            using (var fileStream = File.OpenRead(modelFilePathName))
                                mlModel = mlContext.Model.Load(fileStream);

                            return (TransformerChain<ITransformer>) mlModel;
                        });
    //..Other code..
}
```

Okay, that would be ready for you so you can inject and use the ML model (ITransformer) object on any object, for instance, by injecting it into any controller's constructor, like in the following code:

```cs
MyController.cs

[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly MLContext _mlContext;
    private readonly ITransformer _mlModel;
    
    public MyController(MLContext mlContext, ITransformer mlModel)
    {
        // Get the injected objects
        _mlContext = mlContext;
        _mlModel = mlModel;
    }

    //...Other code using the ML model (ITransformer) object...
}

```

If later on, you create a `PredictionEngine` object whenever you need to call `predictionEngine.Predict()`, either by explicitely creating it with `new` or registering it as `Transient` lifetime, that would be safe in ASP.NET Core.

This is approximately the approach taken by this ML.NET tutorial named [How-To: Serve Machine Learning Model Through ASP.NET Core Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/serve-model-web-api-ml-net)

However, you can do a lot better because with that approach it won't be optimized since whenever you get an Http request you'll be creating a new PredictionEngine object which, as previously mentioned, is a pretty 'expensive' operation for a scalable application if you want to have an optimized performance. 

For achieving the best performance in your application when predicting you will need, somehow, to cache the prediction engine object. But as mentioned, there are important caveats and problems here to solve.


# The problem when running/scoring an ML.NET model in multi-threaded applications

The problem running/scoring an ML.NET model in multi-threaded applications comes when you want to do single predictions with the PredictionEngine object and you want to cache it (i.e. as Singleton or static) so it is being reused by multiple Http requests (therefore it would be accessed by multiple threads)  because **the Prediction Engine is not thread-safe** ([ML.NET issue, Nov 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/1718)).

Here's a diagram showing the important ML.NET classes you need to use, the dependecies between them and what kind of object lifetimes are recommended:

![alt text](images/MLNET-classes-dependencies-for-scoring.png "ML.NET classes dependencies for scoring code with prediction engine")

If you register the Prediction Engine object as Singleton, you will get into trouble because it is not thread-safe.

# The solution: Use Object Pooling for PredictionEngine objects  

Since a PredictionEngine object cannot be singleton because it is not 'thread safe', a good solution for being able to have 'ready to use' PredictionEngine objects  is to use an object pooling-based approach.

When it is necessary to work with a number of objects that are particularly expensive to instantiate and each object is only needed for a short period of time, the performance of an entire application may be adversely affected. This issue will happen if you instantiate a Prediction Engine object whenever you get an Http request.

An object pool design pattern can be very effective in such cases.

The [object pool pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern) is a design pattern that uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use (a 'pool') rather than allocating and destroying them on demand. 

This 'pooling strategy; is also applicable to othe 'expensive creation resources' like database connections and connection pool solution.

The solution's implementation is based on a higher level class (named MLModelEngine) which is instantiated as singleton and creates the needed infrastructure for such an object pool solution, as shown in the following diagram.

![alt text](images/MLModelEngine-class-Diagram.png "MLModelEngine class diagram")

This approach achieves the original goal mentioned at the begining of this article by offering a very simple interface for making predictions: `.Predict()`, like the following line of code that you could write on any ASP.NET Core controller's method or custom service class:

```cs
SamplePrediction prediction = _modelEngine.Predict(sampleData);
```

## Implementing the MLModelEngine and object pool

The class MLModelEngine has three main member objects:

- `MLContext` member object. 
    - Singleton, since MLModelEngine will be used as singleton
- `ITransformer` member object. This is the ML model. 
    - Singleton, since MLModelEngine will be used as singleton
- `ObjectPool<PredictionEngine>` member object: Object Pool of PredictionEngine objects.
    - The ObjectPool is singleton, but each PredictionEngine within the pool will only be used by one thread when needed, then will be returned to the pool when the prediction is done.

The MLModelEngine class implementation is as follows:

```cs
MLModelEngine.cs

public class MLModelEngine<TData, TPrediction> : IMLModelEngine<TData, TPrediction>
                where TData : class
                where TPrediction : class, new()
{
    private readonly MLContext _mlContext;
    private readonly ITransformer _mlModel;
    private readonly ObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>> _predictionEnginePool;
    private readonly int _maxObjectsRetained;

    /// <summary>
    /// Exposing the ML model allowing additional ITransformer operations such as Bulk predictions', etc.
    /// </summary>
    public ITransformer MLModel
    {
        get => _mlModel;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Constructor with modelFilePathName to load from
    /// </summary>
    public MLModelEngine(string modelFilePathName, int maxObjectsRetained = -1)
    {
        //Create the MLContext object to use under the scope of this class 
        _mlContext = new MLContext();

        //Load the ProductSalesForecast model from the .ZIP file
        using (var fileStream = File.OpenRead(modelFilePathName))
        {
            _mlModel = _mlContext.Model.Load(fileStream);
        }

        _maxObjectsRetained = maxObjectsRetained;

        //Create PredictionEngine Object Pool
        _predictionEnginePool = CreatePredictionEngineObjectPool();
    }

    private ObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>> CreatePredictionEngineObjectPool()
    {
        var predEnginePolicy = new PooledPredictionEnginePolicy<TData, TPrediction>(_mlContext, _mlModel);

        DefaultObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>> pool;

        if (_maxObjectsRetained != -1)
        {
            pool = new DefaultObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>>(predEnginePolicy, _maxObjectsRetained);
        }
        else
        {
            //default maximumRetained is Environment.ProcessorCount * 2, if not explicitly provided
            pool = new DefaultObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>>(predEnginePolicy);
        }

        return pool;
    }

    public TPrediction Predict(TData dataSample)
    {
        //Get PredictionEngine object from the Object Pool
        PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction> predictionEngine = _predictionEnginePool.Get();

        try
        {
            //Predict
            TPrediction prediction = predictionEngine.Predict(dataSample);
            return prediction;
        }
        finally
        {
            //Release used PredictionEngine object into the Object Pool
            _predictionEnginePool.Return(predictionEngine);
        }
    }
}

```

What's related to the MLContext and ITransformer objects is pretty straightforward. The 'special code' here is related to the Object Pool.

### Object Pool implementation: ObjectPool<T>

The implementation of the object pool is not using a custom object pool approach but an official class provided by Microsoft in the [Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.objectpool) which is part of .NET Core.

The object pool class used is the [ObjectPool<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.objectpool.objectpool-1), so we can use it as:

`ObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>> _predictionEnginePool;`

Meaning an object pool of `PredictionEngine` objects using generics so you can provide your particular `SampleObservation` and `SamplePrediction` data classes.  

The object pool usage is pretty straightforward in the PRedict() method:

```cs
public TPrediction Predict(TData dataSample)
{
    //Get PredictionEngine object from the Object Pool
    PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction> predictionEngine = _predictionEnginePool.Get();

    try
    {
        //Predict
        TPrediction prediction = predictionEngine.Predict(dataSample);
        return prediction;
    }
    finally
    {
        //Release used PredictionEngine object into the Object Pool
        _predictionEnginePool.Return(predictionEngine);
    }
}
```

Basically, whenever the Predict() method is called, you take a PredictionEngine from the pool, use it to predict and then return it to the pool so it is available for any upcoming request.

If there's not any PredictionEngine object available in the pool (that will happen the first time you use the pool or if under pressure with many Http requests), then the pool needs to create a additional PredictionEngine object.

Basically, you have to solve the following question:

*"How do you tell the object pool how the PredictionEngine object has to be created whenever a new instance is needed in the obejct pool?"*

You do that by using an ObjectPoolPolicy specified when creating the object pool in the `CreatePredictionEngineObjectPool()` method which is run once from the constructor, as in the following simplified code:

```cs
private ObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>> CreatePredictionEngineObjectPool()
{
    var predEnginePolicy = new PooledPredictionEnginePolicy<TData, TPrediction>(_mlContext, _mlModel);

    var pool  = new DefaultObjectPool<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>>(predEnginePolicy);
    
    return pool;
}
```

Then, in the Policy class you define how the PredictionEngine will be created, which is by invoking our 'well known' `ITransformer.CreatePredictionEngine()` method:

```cs
public class PooledPredictionEnginePolicy<TData, TPrediction> : IPooledObjectPolicy<PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>>
                where TData : class
                where TPrediction : class, new()
{
    private readonly MLContext _mlContext;
    private readonly ITransformer _model;
    public PooledPredictionEnginePolicy(MLContext mlContext, ITransformer model)
    {
        _mlContext = mlContext;
        _model = model;
    }

    public PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction> Create()
    {
        var predictionEngine = _model.CreatePredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction>(_mlContext);

        return predictionEngine;
    }

    public bool Return(PredictionEngine<TData, TPrediction> obj)
    {
        if (obj == null)
            return false;

        return true;
    }
}
```

## Registering the MLModelEngine class as singleton for DI (Dependency Injection)

For using this system in your ASP.NET Core WebAPI or web app you just need to register the MLModelEngine class as singleton in the DI system through the `services` collection at the `Startup.cs` like in the following code:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...Other code...

    // Register as singleton in the IoC container for DI
    services.AddSingleton<MLModelEngine<SampleObservation, SamplePrediction>>((ctx) =>
                            {
                                string modelFilePathName = GetAbsolutePath(Configuration["MLModel:MLModelFilePath"]);
                                return new MLModelEngine<SampleObservation, SamplePrediction>(modelFilePathName);
                            });
}
```

Since we need the filepath pointing to the model's .ZIP, we're using a lambda function as a factory to be able to provide that info to the constructor.

## Using the injected MLModelEngine object from your WebAPI controllers to make predictions

Using the injected MLModelEngine object from your WebAPI controllers to make predictions is very simple.

First, the MLModelEngine object is injected in the controller's constructor.

Second, you simple use it by calling the .Predict() method, as in the following controller's code for a sentiment prediction example:

```cs
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class PredictorController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly MLModelEngine<SampleObservation, SamplePrediction> _modelEngine;

    public PredictorController(MLModelEngine<SampleObservation, SamplePrediction> modelEngine)
    {
        // Get the ML Model Engine injected, for scoring
        _modelEngine = modelEngine;
    }

    // GET api/predictor/sentimentprediction?sentimentText=ML.NET is awesome!
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("sentimentprediction")]
    public ActionResult<string> PredictSentiment([FromQuery]string sentimentText)
    {
        SampleObservation sampleData = new SampleObservation() { SentimentText = sentimentText };

        //Predict sentiment
        SamplePrediction prediction = _modelEngine.Predict(sampleData);

        return retVal = prediction.IsToxic.ToString();
    }
}
```

With that, we achieved our original goal for making super simple to predict with an ML.NET model while having good performance with the implemented optimizations.

Here's a high level end-to-end architecture diagram of the Web API using the MLModelEngine with the Object Pool of PredictionEngine objects.
